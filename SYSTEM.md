# System Design Roadmap

## 1. Basics of System Design

### **Learn Fundamentals**
- **What is System Design?**  
  Understand its definition, real-world importance, and relevance in interviews.
- **Key Components**:
  - Clients
  - Servers
  - Databases
  - Load balancers
  - Caches

### **Topics to Cover**
- Networking Basics:
  - DNS
  - HTTP/HTTPS
  - TCP/IP
  - WebSockets
- Client-Server Architecture
- RESTful APIs vs. gRPC
- Data Formats:
  - JSON
  - XML
  - Protocol Buffers

### **Resources**
- Books:  
  _"Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach"_ by Kurose and Ross
- Websites:  
  - GeeksforGeeks  
  - Educative.io (System Design Path)

## 2. Core Building Blocks

### **Learn Key Concepts**
- Horizontal vs. Vertical Scaling
- Latency and Throughput
- CAP Theorem (Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance)
- ACID vs. BASE Properties

### **Components to Master**
- **Load Balancers**:  
  Round-robin, Least Connections
- **Caching**:  
  Redis, Memcached, CDN (Content Delivery Networks)
- **Databases**:  
  SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL), NoSQL (MongoDB, Cassandra, DynamoDB)
- **Message Queues**:  
  Kafka, RabbitMQ, SQS

### **Practice**
- Implement a simple caching mechanism.
- Design a system to scale a database horizontally.

## 3. High-Level Design

### **Learn to Design Systems**
- Requirements Gathering:
  - Functional vs. Non-functional Requirements
- High-level architecture diagrams:
  - UML
  - Sequence Diagrams
- Data flow and modularity

### **Sample Systems to Design**
- URL Shortener (e.g., TinyURL)
- Social Media Feed (e.g., Instagram feed)
- Chat Application (e.g., WhatsApp)
- File Storage System (e.g., Google Drive)

  - GraphQL  
- Service Discovery Tools:
  - Consul  
  - Eureka  
- API Gateway:
  - Kong  
  - Apigee  

### **Cloud Computing**
- Basics of Cloud Services:
  - AWS  
  - Azure  
  - GCP  
- Cloud Architecture Design:
  - S3  
  - EC2  
  - Lambda  
- Serverless Architecture

### **DevOps Tools**

## 7. Security and Optimization

### **Security**
- Authentication and Authorization:
  - OAuth  
  - JWT  
  - OpenID  
- Encryption:
  - TLS  
  - HTTPS  
- Preventing Common Vulnerabilities:
  - SQL Injection  
  - XSS  
  - CSRF  

### **Optimization**
- Database Indexing and Query Optimization
- Caching Strategies and CDN Integration
- Performance Testing Tools:
  - JMeter  
  - Gatling  

---

## 8. System Design Interview Preparation

### **Prepare for Interview Scenarios**
- Practice designing scalable and distributed systems.
- Prepare for trade-off questions:
  - Latency vs. Availability  
  - Consistency vs. Partition Tolerance  
- Learn to estimate system resources (bandwidth, storage, servers).

### **Mock Interview Questions**
- Design YouTube or Netflix
- Design a Payment Gateway
- Design a Ride-Sharing Service (e.g., Uber)
